# Summary Wars 📊

A sophisticated tool for evaluating and comparing meeting summary quality, built with v0 by Vercel.

## Overview

Summary Wars is an internal tool designed to help prompt engineers and AI developers evaluate and compare different versions of meeting summaries generated by various prompts or models. The tool provides a side-by-side comparison interface with AI-powered evaluation metrics to determine which summary version is superior.


## Few Key Mentions

There are two models availble `gpt-4.1` and `o3-mini-medium`, 4.1 is new and added as an experimental/fun feature. 
The go-to model for this task would be o3 as it has complex reasoning capabilities but early information about 4.1 say that it has similar capabilites while being faster and cheaper. Also it is supposedly better at needle in a haystack benchmarks.
